# **Activity: Basic Prototyping in Figma**

### **Objective:**
Learn how to create basic interactive prototypes in Figma by linking different frames to simulate a user flow for a mobile app.

### **Instructions:**

1. **Set up your Figma environment:**
   - Create a free Figma account at [figma.com](https://figma.com).
   - Open a new file and name it **“Basic Prototyping Practice.”**

2. **Design a Simple Mobile App Interface:**
   - Create 3 frames (mobile-sized) representing different screens of a basic app:
     - **Frame 1:** Welcome Screen with a "Get Started" button.
     - **Frame 2:** Login Screen with "Login" and "Sign Up" buttons.
     - **Frame 3:** Home Screen with a welcome message like "Welcome, [Username]!".
   
3. **Link the Frames to Create Interactivity:**
   - Use the **Prototype** tab to create interactions:
     - Link **Frame 1's "Get Started"** button to **Frame 2** (Login Screen).
     - Link the **Login** button on **Frame 2** to **Frame 3** (Home Screen).
   
4. **Set up Basic Transitions:**
   - Add transitions (e.g., **Instant** or **Dissolve**) between the screens to create a seamless user flow.

5. **Preview the Prototype:**
   - Click the play button in the top right to preview the prototype and interact with it.
   
6. **Submit Your Work:**
   - After completing the prototype, share the Figma link with your instructor.

### **Video Reference:**
